    "\n",
    "There are longstanding concerns about unevenness in the distribution of voluntary organisations across local areas, re-emphasised by the sector’s role in responding to the pandemic. Using longitudinal data on a subset of voluntary organisations across six census periods (1971-2021), we estimate growth trajectories in the number of charities per capita for local authorities across England and Wales. We assess whether the shape of these trajectories is associated with an area’s demographic and geographic characteristics, including its level of material deprivation, ethnic composition and regional location. We reveal sizeable, enduring and widening differences between local authorities over time, but find a homogenous growth trajectory for all areas. Our findings suggest that national efforts are needed to address inequalities in the distribution of charitable organisations, as well as reverse recent declines in the per capita density of these organisations. \n",

Ideally these residuals are unexplainable e.g., due to luck, random chance etc, but this is only the case when you have **only** and **all** relevant covariates in your model (rarely the case))."
